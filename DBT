Modelling
 Model is essentially a select statement 
 Models are defined .sql files
 Typically in model directly
 
 Seeds are the local files that we upload to data warehouse from dbt
 Seeds are the small csv files that reside in seeds folder
 Source is an abstraction layer, on the top of your input table
 Source freshness can be checked automatically
 add in source.yml file under models folder
 freshness:
          warn_after: {count: 1, period: hour}
          error_after: {count: 24, period: hour}
 
 dbt run --> executes compiled sql model files against the current target database. 
 dbt run --full-refresh   --> Making a full-refresh:
 dbt seed --> seed file gets copied to snowflake
